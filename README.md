## **Problem:**

To predict and analyze global CO​2​ level and global temperature level by analysing data from previously recorded data.

## **Motivation:**

To create a system that predicts and analyses global temperatures and global CO2 levels, in order to tackle Global Warming. According to the U.S. Energy officials, in 2017 the US emitted 5.1 billion metric tons of energy-related carbon dioxide, a good number that contributes to increasing wildfires, rising sea levels, catastrophic hurricanes and changes in the climate. According to National Geographic, the average temperature of the Earth is rising at nearly twice the rate it was 50 years ago. This rapid warming trend cannot be explained by natural cycles alone, scientists have concluded. The only way to explain the pattern is to include the effect of greenhouse gases (GHGs) emitted by humans.
This boils down to the day to day activities of humans. We aim to analyze previous as well as current data on the global CO2 levels and create awareness about Global Warming. We aim to show a relation between the amount of CO2 and the overall rise in global temperature. This analysis can be used further to decide national/global climate change policies.
